## About QuickCenter

QuickCenter is a set of tools developers use with Guidewire Software implementations.

## History & Inception

Joseph was a Mac advocate for many years and was quite excited to run the centers on his Macbook while an employee of Guidewire Software in 2006. Although performance and the user interface were a bit dodgy back then, Joseph wrote several shell scripts to enhance his workflow.

Jeff also held at-home experience with the Mac for many years and was finally able to make his work move to macOS in 2018. As a Guidewire Digital developer with an obnoxious amount of moving parts, Jeff took advantage of the need to expedite his daily workflow and created a handful of shell scripts.

Thus, the initial iteration of tools was crafted for macOS. Recently we unveiled a set of batch scripts for Windows parity. These tools simplify our daily work lives and we hope it helps simplifies yours.

More tools and refinements are on the way!
