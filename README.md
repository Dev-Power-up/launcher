## About Dev Power-Up!

Dev Power-Up! is a set of tools developers use with Guidewire Software implementations.

## History & Inception

I am an advocate of both the macOS and productivity improvement and I was excited to run all Guidewire centers on my MacBook as an employee of Guidewire Software in 2006. Although performance and the user interface were dodgy back then, I wrote several shell scripts to enhance my workflow.

I crafted the initial iteration of toolsÂ for macOS, but transformed the same set of scripts for Windows parity. These tools simplify my daily work and I hope it helps simplifies yours.
