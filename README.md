## About Dev Power-Up!

Dev Power-Up! is a set of tools developers use with Guidewire Software implementations.

## History & Inception

Joseph has been a Mac advocate for many years and was excited to run all Guidewire centers on his MacBook as an employee of Guidewire Software in 2006. Although performance and the user interface were dodgy back then, Joseph wrote several shell scripts to enhance his workflow.

Jeff also held at-home experience with the Mac for many years and could finally make his work move to macOS in 2018. As a Guidewire Digital developer with an obnoxious amount of moving parts, Jeff took advantage of the need to expedite his daily workflow and created a handful of shell scripts.

As such, we crafted the initial iteration of toolsÂ for macOS, but recently transformed the same set of scripts for Windows parity. These tools simplify our daily work lives and we hope it helps simplifies yours.
